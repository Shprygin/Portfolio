**In this folder one can find my projects for the Deep Lerning Course. Here are file on working with many kinds of NN, like RNN, CNN, BERT and others**

🌐 HW1 - The first project on comparing logreg, decision forest and NN performance on binary classification task with tabular numeric exogenous variables.

🌐 HW2 - The second project where I try PyTorch and do backpropagation manually / with AutoGrad

🌐 HW Kaggle - The third project on building a CNN image classifier. Used transfer learning with fine-tuning and won the competition

🌐 HW4 -
