**In this folder one can find my projects for the Deep Lerning Course. Here are file on working with many kinds of NN, like RNN, CNN, BERT and others**

🌐 HW1 - First project on comparing logreg, decision forest and NN performance on binary classification task with tabular numeric exogenous variables.

🌐 HW2 - Second project where I try PyTorch and do backpropagation manually / with AutoGrad

🌐 HW3 -

🌐 HW Kaggle -

🌐 HW4 -
