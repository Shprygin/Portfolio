ðŸ“š **ML final project** - Binary regression task with detailed preprocessing stage. LogReg, Decision Forrests, NaÃ¯ve Bayes and NN used. For target variable imbalance SMOTE oversampling employed

ðŸ“š **Clusterizing** - Applying different clusterizing algortihms for clusterizing unknown variables (Kaggle)

ðŸ“š **cloudbuilder-2** - One of the projects done at work. Created an NLP pipeline that would automatically process open questions in polls and visualize tham in a form of word clouds. The language used is Russian. I have also manually added some features to extract the words correctly. For example, 'Ð½Ðµ Ð»ÑŽÐ±Ð»ÑŽ' (Ð½Ðµ = do not, Ð»ÑŽÐ±Ð»ÑŽ = love), would have been processed as simply Ñ…Ð¾Ñ€Ð¾ÑˆÐ¸Ð¹ if the traditional Russian language preprocessing was used. However, I  programmed a pipleline that would extract "Ð½Ðµ_Ñ…Ð¾Ñ€Ð¾ÑˆÐ¸Ð¹" instead, many other common Russian figure of speech were implemented as well. As a result, I  achieved such high simmilarity between my tokenization and manulual codificiation they were hardly distinguishable.
