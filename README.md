# Portfolio

Hello! My name is Lev (Russian for Lion) and here's a repository of my projects. My goal is becoming a Product Owner one day, so I polish my analytical skills at work and university and this repository contains some.  Unluckily, the most work projet cannot be shared so I would recommend check the Study folder. Some projects are not code but reports with graphs and all necessary numbers. Since I pursue not a developer/coder career, rather than an analytical-managerial one, code for me is only an instrument, the key is analytical instruments, some of which are shown in the repository. However, you can also view the code in some projects.

The instruments I use the most include: Python, STATA, SQL, Orange, etc.

_Table of contents_

üìö **study** - different projects I did in my uni. They are all done on real data and I tries to make them as appliable to real tasks as possible. 

üëØ **Extraverersion** - A project to build a neural network to determine the user's extraversion.  At the moment, the code for feature extraction is finished, parts of which are just in the folder. At the moment, a toy-example neural network is being developed

ü§¨ **Bullies** - a project to identify bullies out of users who are members of a support group. At the moment, the stage of data parsing and the development of a methodology for determining potential bullies (draft: by groups, music, pictures, etc.)

üè¶ **cbr** - A selection of working projects made in the Bank of Russia: automation, parsing,  data preparation.
